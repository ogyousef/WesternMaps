README File for application instructions

To begin the application, run the executable file or run Main.java in an IDE. The program requires
at least Java 10 to be run. If running in an IDE, ensure a resource folder is included with all files
in the same location they are set in this zip file.

Running the application in an IDE will also require the json-simple external library. This library
is included in the zip file.
Another required library is the "Flat Look and Feel" library included in the zip file.

After running, A log in screen will appear. You can log into the program by registering a new account
with a custom username and password, or you can log in using the administrator account.

username: admin
password: 123456

Logging in as an administrator will allow you to add new maps, delete maps, and edit the default 
points of interest. All in addition to the regular functions available to all users.

After logging in, the first screen is the main menu. To view a map, click on the picture of the
building, then click "View Building". This will take you to the floor viewer. From here, you can add
points of interest, favourite POIs, toggle layers, and change floors. There is also a help button 
in the top right to clarify all functions in greater detail.

To exit the application cleanly, click the log out button. This will sign you out and return you to the
log in page.
